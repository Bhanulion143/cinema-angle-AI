TITLE:
    Cinema AngleAI: AI Agent for Automatic Camera-Angle 
    Generation in Movie Scenes

ABSTRACT:
    Cinematography is essential to storytelling, yet selecting
    the right camera angles for a movie scene requires skill,
    time, and experience. This project introduces CineAngleAI,
    an AI-powered agent that automatically analyzes a movie
    scene description and generates professional camera-angle
    recommendations, including shot types, camera movements,
    and cinematography style. The system uses NLP to extract
    scene elements—characters, actions, emotions, setting—
    and applies a rule-based cinematography engine to produce
    a structured shot list. CineAngleAI assists filmmakers,
    students, writers, and creators in planning high-quality
    visual storytelling.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    Filmmakers spend hours planning camera angles for each
    scene. Beginners lack cinematography knowledge, causing
    poor visual narration. There is no tool that converts 
    written scene descriptions into expert-level camera-angle
    suggestions automatically. This project aims to automate
    shot planning using AI.

OBJECTIVES:
    ✔ Understand scene descriptions using NLP
    ✔ Identify characters, actions, emotions, setting
    ✔ Apply cinematography logic to generate shot types
    ✔ Output a structured camera-angle shot list
    ✔ Help creators visualize scenes professionally

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
    - Python
    - spaCy NLP
    - Rule-based Cinematography Engine
    - Command-line Interface (CLI)
